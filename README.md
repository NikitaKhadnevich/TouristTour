### Some Words

Hello every one! There is demo SPA about traveling for tourists.\
This application includes a little bit JS but has a lot of HTML + SCSS/SASS\
this is my vision of what it might look like WEB Landing for business, small companies etc.\
Its work too easy - open `index.html` file in your browser and scroll down))\
By the way For work with SASS you might use `npm run sass`
Also you can see this application here => [Link to GitHub Pages](https://nikitakhadnevich.github.io/ArtLanding).
